# Overview

WinterFixesTwitter is a bot named after Aespa's very own Kim Min Jeong (aka Winter). I made this bot because I was sick and tired of copying and pasting twitter links and editing it to have `fxtwitter` instead of `x` or `twitter`. So this just does that process automatically - nothing really much other than that!

# Installation
Feel free to fork this repo and deploy it!

Run this bot locally by replacing `TOKEN` with your own token and running:
```
python main.py
```
